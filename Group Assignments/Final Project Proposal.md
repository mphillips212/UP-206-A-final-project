# Project Proposal: Group Assignment 1

## Introduction

We propose to research and map the availability and quality of existing “dirty” energy jobs versus green jobs across California. To that end, our research will answer the following questions: 

1. Where in California are existing fossil fuel/"dirty" energy jobs located relative to green jobs? 
2. What are the demographics in the regions where green jobs are located relative to fossil fuel jobs?

Evaluated together, these research questions will provide a visualization of geographic accessibility of clean energy jobs versus fossil fuel jobs for disadvantaged communities. Disadvantaged communities are defined as the top 25% scoring areas from CalEnviroScreen, which considers socioeconomic, public health and environmental hazard criteria.

## Project Relevance: Why is our project important and what is at stake? 

Our research will inform the work of California’s Green New Deal (CA GND) Coalition, a coalition of community organizations that advocates for rapid de-carbonization across the state to create a vibrant zero-carbon economy for all Californians. We will provide easy-to-understand maps to support the CA GND Coalition’s efforts to reintroduce a California Green New Deal bill in upcoming legislative sessions. Their work is of particular urgency in this moment; as the nation prepares for a Biden-Harris administration, we have an opportunity at the state level to advance an inclusive, just transition that can serve as a model for national policy.

A fundamental goal of the California Green New Deal (CA GND) Coalition is to create good quality green jobs for low-income communities of color in California. Yet, a transition to green jobs inevitably means a loss of fossil fuel jobs—jobs that often employ people from and are located in disadvantaged communities. Our project aims to support the CA GNC Coalition with comparative, spatialized insight into the workforce realities of two twinned processes: a transition to clean energy and away from fossil fuel. To ensure an equitable, just transition, we must understand the extent to which green jobs are more or less geographically accessible to disadvantaged communities.

## Spatial Scope: Why space and time matter to our project


## Data Sources

[CA Energy Commission Power Plants Data](https://cecgis-caenergy.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/california-power-plants/data?geometry=-154.211%2C31.065%2C-75.461%2C43.271). This dataset provides the location of every power plant in California, both renewable and fossil fuel. It contains data on plant emissions and lifespan as well. This data will allow us to map power plants across the state by type.

[2018 County Business Patterns Data](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?g=0400000US06.050000&d=ANN%20Business%20Patterns%20County%20Business%20Patterns&n=2111%3A2211%3A2212%3A32411%3A486&tid=CBP2018.CB1800CBP&hidePreview=true). This County Business Patterns (CBP) data provides employment numbers among fossil fuel and renewable energy sectors across all counties in California. We narrowed the CBP data down to five relevant NAICS codes: 2111 (Oil and gas extraction), 2211 (Electric power generation), 2212 (Natural gas distribution), 32411 (Petroleum refineries), and 486 (Pipeline transportation). We will need to narrow down NAICS 2211 to just fossil fuel plants, and may need to include other NAICS codes (e.g. gas stations) depending on how relevant they are to our analysis.

[CalEnviroScreen 3.0 Data](https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/calenviroscreen/document/ces3results.xlsx). Using data from CalEnviroScreen will enable us to situate the fossil fuel and renewable energy sectors with larger social demographics. This dataset is especially useful for understanding the spatial distribution of energy resources in the state and provides an explicit focus on the environmental justice dimensions of energy production.
