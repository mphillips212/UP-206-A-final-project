# Project Proposal: Group Assignment 1

## Introduction

We propose to research and map the availability and quality of existing “dirty” energy jobs versus green jobs across California. To that end, our research will answer the following questions: 

1. Where in California are existing fossil fuel/"dirty" energy jobs located relative to green jobs? 
2. What are the demographics in the regions where green jobs are located relative to fossil fuel jobs?

Evaluated together, these research questions will provide a visualization of geographic accessibility of clean energy jobs versus fossil fuel jobs for disadvantaged communities. Disadvantaged communities are defined as the top 25% scoring areas from CalEnviroScreen, which considers socioeconomic, public health and environmental hazard criteria.

## Project Relevance: Why is our project important and what is at stake? 

Our research will inform the work of California’s Green New Deal (CA GND) Coalition, a coalition of community organizations that advocates for rapid de-carbonization across the state to create a vibrant zero-carbon economy for all Californians. We will provide easy-to-understand maps to support the CA GND Coalition’s efforts to reintroduce a California Green New Deal bill in upcoming legislative sessions. Their work is of particular urgency in this moment; as the nation prepares for a Biden-Harris administration, we have an opportunity at the state level to advance an inclusive, just transition that can serve as a model for national policy.
A fundamental goal of the California Green New Deal (CA GND) Coalition is to create good quality green jobs for low-income communities of color in California. Yet, a transition to green jobs inevitably means a loss of fossil fuel jobs—jobs that often employ people from and are located in disadvantaged communities. Our project aims to support the CA GNC Coalition with comparative, spatialized insight into the workforce realities of two twinned processes: a transition to clean energy and away from fossil fuel. To ensure an equitable, just transition, we must understand the extent to which green jobs are more or less geographically accessible to disadvantaged communities.
